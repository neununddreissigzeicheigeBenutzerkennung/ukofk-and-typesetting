%%% This package aims to provide a versitile \list controll sequence which takes custom \bullet's (#1) and then takes care of spacing for the \item's in #2. For more detailled information view the example document.
%%% A  few extra controll sequences where used to achive \list's functionality which if not helpfull may at least be interesting to some and are thus also shown off in the example document.

% This dimension is for keeping track of individual bullet's width.
\newdimen\bulletwidth%
% This dimension is for keeping track of the maximum bullet width in a list.
\newdimen\bulletswidth%
% This dimension is used for transcending the borders of one \box whithout using \global.
\newdimen\transcendebullets%
% This controll sequence is for keeping track of the arguments #2 of contextwidth up to the current one.
\def\currentcontext{}%
% This controll sequence is for keeping track of the arguments #2 of contextwidth up to the previous one.
