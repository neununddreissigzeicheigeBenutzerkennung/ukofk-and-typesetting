 \code Environment Package (Version 1.0)

Summary:
--------
The code.tex script provides a custom environment (\code) for typesetting code snippets in TeX documents. The \code environment ensures that TeX obeys line breaks and tabs, and uses a typewriter font for code readability. Additionally, it offers a \comment command to add "//" comment indicators and move subsequent text to the right of the line. This command should be used only at the end of a line of code.

Dependencies:
-------------
This package has no external dependencies. It is designed to work with any TeX distribution that supports plain TeX.

Usage:
------
To use the \code environment:

1. Add the code.tex script to your TeX installation. Place the script in a directory where TeX searches for input files by default. Common directories include the current working directory, directories specified in the TEXINPUTS environment variable, or directories configured in your TeX distribution's settings.

2. Include code.tex in your TeX document using the \input command. Since the script is now part of your TeX installation, you won't need to specify the full path to the script every time you use \input. For example:

    \input code.tex

3. Use the \code environment to enclose code snippets in your document. You can also use the \comment command to add comments at the end of lines.

Example Usage:
--------------
Below is a minimal example demonstrating the usage of the \code environment in a TeX document:

\input code.tex

\code
\def\hello{Hello, world!}
\def\greeting#1{%
  \bye
  \hello
}

\greeting{Alice}
\end
\endcode

This example prints a code snippet with a function definition and invocation.
